# Clustering Noisy Rings

This assignment is inspired by a real subproblem from the LHCb experiment conducted at CERN. They use pattern recognition algorithms for the RICH (Ring Imaging CHerenkov) detectors. These detectors aim to detect round or elliptic patterns caused by the impact of Cherenkov radiation. Cherenkov radiation refers to the emission of cones of photons by particles resulting from hadron collisions when these particles travel through a special gas at a speed higher than the speed of light in that gas medium.

The objective of this algorithm is to search for circumferences in pre-generated circumferences. Furthermore, it should explicitly account for uncertainty in its calculations.
